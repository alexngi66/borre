                   ONCORE GPS CONTROLLER SOFTWARE
 

LOADING
-------

     In order to correctly load the GPS Control Program software,
place the program disk into the appropriate size disk drive and
transfer control to the disk drive ( ex: a: <CR> ).

     Type the following command at the prompt:

              gpsload <source_drive> <target_drive> <CR>
              ( ex: gpsload a: c: <CR> )

     The GPS Control Program and all essential utility files will
be transferred into a subdirectory of the target drive's root
directory.  The name of the subdirectory will be \GPS.  If this
subdirectory already exists, a prompt will be provided to 
determine if the user wishes to over-write any files with like 
names or terminate the GPSLOAD program.

     Provided within the utility subdirectory of the newly created
GPS Control Program directory are two files: 1.) MARKNET.EXE, and
2.) RELNET.EXE.  These files are part of the TSR Utilities package
produced by TurboPower Software and are provided free of charge.


EXECUTING
---------

     In order to execute the GPS Control Program, the user's
present working directory must be (a) either in the GPS controller
program directory (e.g. c:\gps), or (b) have the directory called
out in the DOS "PATH=" stream of the PC's AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  The 
GPS Control Program will start by typing the following at the 
prompt:    
        gps <CR>

CREATING A MASTER DISK
----------------------

      To create more diskettes similar to the master diskette you
received from PNSB, be sure you are in the same directory as the 
batch files are located in, then use the appropriate batch file 
depending upon which diskette drive your new disk resides in.  If
your diskette is in drive a: run the file COPYTOA.BAT by typing
the following at the prompt:
                             copytoa <CR>

Or, if your diskette is in drive b: execute the file COPYTOB.BAT.
